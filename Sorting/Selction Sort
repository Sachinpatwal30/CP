This algo sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning

  Algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.
	1.The subarray which already sorted on left.
	2.The remaining subarray was unsorted on right.

Steps:-
   1. find the smallest element is the unsorted array(right side of ith element) 
   2. and then Swap it with ith element 
   
   
  void selectionSort(int x[]) {

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

      int mini = i;                      //storing smallest element index
      for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
        if (x[j] < x[mini])
          mini = j;

      }

      swap(x[mini], x[i]);

    }

  }
  
  
  
Selection sort â€“ 
Best, average and worst case time complexity: n^2 which is independent of distribution of data.
